Sample data will be taken from `./sample/'.  All pairs of matching
(.in, .ans) files there will be used as sample data, in alphabetical
order by file name.  This data will be displayed in the problem
statement.

Secret test data will be taken from `./secret/'. All pairs of matching
(.in, .ans) files there will be used to test each
submission. Optionally a text file (with filename extension .txt)
describing the purpose of an input file may be present. For each .txt
file there must be a matching (.in,.ans) pair.


SAMPLE TEST DESCRIPTIONS:

---- First 2 tests primarily for contestant understanding of problem, sample 3 to trick wrong answer contestants ----

sample1: Secure system example with small n = 4

sample2: Non-secure system test with non-polydivisible number = 63

sample3: Will pass this test with Wrong Answer example, potentially giving false confidence to contestants who implemented incorrectly


SECRET TEST DESCRIPTIONS:

secret1: Small n test case (n = 1) but with large L

secret2: Small mixed case (n = 3). Tests early failures given large L

secret3: Checks secure system with n = 5 and larger L than sample tests

secret4: Secure system with n = 20 and mix of short and large L

secret5: All numbers non-polydivisible (n = 10). Ensures all invalid numbers are listed in correct order of appearance

secret6: Five long near-polydivisible numbers (~2000–4000 digits). Stress-tests long-prefix parsing, ensures linear L parse instead of naive L^2 solution

secret7: Another long-number stress test. Same test as secret6, ensures modular increments are done right

secret8: Large mixed case (n = 800). Tests performance on many short/medium inputs.

secret9: Large mixed case (n = 000). Ensures linear scanning over many lines -> O(n) ensured

secret10: Large all-insecure (n = 1000)

secret11: Large secure system with n = 500 (500 valid numbers). Verifies “secure” logic with big input.

secret12: Large mixed case (n = 1000). Performance and correctness.

secret13: Large mixed case (n = 1000). More performance testing.

secret14: Additional large mixed case (n = 1000). Final stress-test on large n

secret15: Medium mixed case (n ≈ 40). Normal random test

secret16: Medium mixed case (n ≈ 40). Normal random test


---- Final random tests with varying n levels ----
secret17: Random mixed case (n = 20–40).
secret18: Random mixed case (n = 20–40).
secret19: Random mixed case (n = 20–40).
secret20: Random mixed case (n = 20–40).
