Sample data will be taken from `./sample/'.  All pairs of matching
(.in, .ans) files there will be used as sample data, in alphabetical
order by file name.  This data will be displayed in the problem
statement.

Secret test data will be taken from `./secret/'. All pairs of matching
(.in, .ans) files there will be used to test each
submission. Optionally a text file (with filename extension .txt)
describing the purpose of an input file may be present. For each .txt
file there must be a matching (.in,.ans) pair.


This problem includes 4 sample tests and 20 secret tests.  
Below is a description of what each test case is designed to verify.

------------------------------------------------------------
SAMPLE TESTS
------------------------------------------------------------

sample1
    Small mix of secure and insecure passcodes.
    Verifies basic functionality and correct listing order.

sample2
    All passcodes are polydivisible.
    Ensures solver prints only "secure" with no extra lines.

sample3
    All passcodes are insecure.
    Tests formatting of multiple failing passcodes.

sample4
    Multiple short secure passcodes.
    Ensures correct handling of simple polydivisible cases.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECRET TESTS
------------------------------------------------------------

secret1 – secret3
    Very small mixed cases (n = 1–3).
    Ensures correctness on minimal inputs and no assumptions on n.

secret4 – secret5
    All-secure cases generated by polydivisible backtracking.
    Verify correct detection of fully secure firewalls.

secret6 – secret7
    All-insecure cases.
    Include large random numbers (up to thousands of digits) to
    ensure solver handles long inputs and detects every failure.

secret8 – secret9
    Medium mixed cases including:
        - short secure numbers
        - long random insecure numbers
    Verifies correct interaction of secure and insecure logic.

secret10 – secret12
    Near-polydivisible long stress tests.
    These strings pass prefix divisibility for hundreds or thousands
    of positions and then fail late.
    Ensures deep prefix checking and detects early-termination hacks.

secret13 – secret14
    Mixed mid-size cases.
    Combine:
        - real polydivisible numbers
        - long insecure random numbers
        - near-polydivisible long numbers
    Ensures correctness on arbitrary mixtures.

secret15 – secret16
    Large mixed cases (20–40 passcodes) with long numbers.
    Stress test runtime and memory to detect O(n * L^2) solutions.

secret17 – secret18
    Additional large mixed tests.
    Ensure consistent performance on varying proportions of secure,
    insecure, and near-polydivisible numbers.

secret19
    Mixed case containing all categories.
    Tests full robustness of solver.

secret20
    Final heavy stress test.
    Emphasizes long random and near-polydivisible inputs to guarantee
    TLE for naive substring-building or quadratic solutions.
